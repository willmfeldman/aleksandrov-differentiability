# Compact Straszewicz theorem

This module assembles the compact finite-dimensional Straszewicz theorem from the source-shaped
pieces in `ConvexHull` and `SupportingBall`.

/-- Finite-dimensional compact-convex Straszewicz theorem.

Every extreme point of a compact convex set is a limit of exposed points.  The proof follows the
Rockafellar source route: assume an extreme point is not in the exposed-point closure, separate it
from `conv (closure exposedPoints)`, then use the supporting-ball construction to find an exposed
point on the wrong side of the separating halfspace. -/

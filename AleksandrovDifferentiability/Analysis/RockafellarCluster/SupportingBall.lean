# Supporting balls in the Straszewicz argument

This module contains the elementary Hilbert-space geometry used in Rockafellar's proof of
Straszewicz's theorem: a point of a set which is farthest from a center is exposed by the
supporting hyperplane to the corresponding closed ball.

/-- A farthest point from a sufficiently shifted center lies outside the separating halfspace.

This is the Pythagorean calculation in Rockafellar's proof of Straszewicz's theorem.  The center is
`x - lam • normal`, where `x` is outside the halfspace `{z | inner normal z ≤ u}`.  If all points of
`s` are close enough to `x`, then any point at least as far from this shifted center as `x` cannot
belong to that halfspace. -/
